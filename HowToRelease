Release procedures for OpenDMARC

0) Run "./copyright-check" to ensure anything updated in the current year has
   a current copyright notice in it.

1) Edit configure.ac so that the new release number is formed with the
   VERSION_RELEASE* macros.

2) In the root build directory, do these things:

	% make distclean
	% autoreconf
	% ./configure
	% make
	% make distcheck

   This will produce an opendmarc-(version).tar.gz tarball after running
   all unit tests.  (Although we leave it to github to create these for us now)

3) Commit changes made to RELEASE_NOTES to the GitHub repository.
   Be sure to include any open feature requests, patches or bug fixes
   from the GitHub issue list.

4) Prepare a release announcement by using the file "announcement" from git
   as your template.  Change the From: to the name and address of the person
   making the announcement.  Make sure that address has permissions to post
   to opendmarc-users and opendmarc-announce.  There should be a paragraph
   or two at the top highlighting the interesting changes and indicating
   what the main focus of this release is (new features, bug fixes, etc.),
   and then the full RELEASE_NOTES block for the new release.  Commit this
   to GitHub.

5) Merge the "develop" branch to the "master" branch, as follows:

	% git checkout master
	% git merge develop
	[massage in and commit any conflicts]
	% git push

6) Create a new release on GitHub per github docs:
   https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository

   (This will create both the GitHub "tag" as well as the "release")

7) Send the release announcement:

	% sendmail -t < announcement
